# Date2Exif

Are your Whatsapp (or any other) images not being displayed according to date by the photo gallery?



This is likely due to the absence of the exif metadata which Whatsapp strips from the .jpgÂ when they are backed up.
This tool will take the "date taken info" from the name of the image and insert it into the image's exif metadata.



The date should be found in the name in the format "YYYYMMDD" whith no other numbers to the left if it. It also supports "YYYYDDMM", "DDMMYYY" and "MMDDYYYY". Spacing or dashes between the date is fine. Only works for .jpg and jpeg
